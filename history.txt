Easy Populate

The point of easy populate is to let someone use an excel file exported to
a tab delimited file to set up their entire store:
categories, products, manufacturers, quantities, and prices.

-----------------------------------
Modified by Tim Wasson - Wasson65 (wasson65@nc.rr.com) to:
 accept category/subcategory names
 allow reordering of columns in csv file
 accept manufacturer name or id
 some minor code simplification
 accept and set status of the product if desired
 changed all # to // comment markers so KDE's Kate will syntax highlight correctly
 added support for default images for products, categories, and categories.
 added support for exporting a csv file that can be modified and sent back in.
-----------------------------------
1.1 Changes
 Fixed a stupid bug, I didn't change the references to easypopulate.php from excel.php
 Added note in the docs that if the Excel import is already done, don't need to do the alter table
 Removed the extra semicolon on the end of the line in the csv download.  It prevented you from exporting and importing a file.
-----------------------------------
1.2 Fixes
More bugs fixed
___________________________________
1.3 Fixes
Added another link to put csv file in temp file for access via tools->files, for some windows machines that refuse to dl right...
-----------------------------------
1.4 Fixes
Switchted to tabs for delimiters
Strip cr's and tab's from strings before exporting
Added explicit end of row field
Added ability to split a big file into smaller files in the temp dir
Preserve double quotes, single quotes, and apostrophes and commas
Removed references to category_root, it's no longer required
------------------------------------
1.5 Fixes
Changed --EOR-- to EOREOR for better excel usability.
Made script accept "EOREOR" or EOREOR without the quotes.
If inserting a new product, delete any product_descriptions with that product_id to avoid an error if old data was still present.
------------------------------------
1.6 Fixes
Ooops, manufacturer_id variable misspellings meant that mfg wasn't getting set or updated
Whe I re-arranged the code, I left out the call to actually put the data into the products table.  Ooops again...
------------------------------------
1.61 Fixes
One more manufacturer id name fix.
------------------------------------
Skipped to 2.0 because of the big jump in functionality
------------------------------------
2.0
Made EP handle magic-quotes
Thanks to Joshua Dechant aka dreamscape, for this fix
Rewrote the categories part to handle any number of categories
------------------------------------
2.1
Fix split files not splitting.
Change from "file" to "fgets" to read the file to be split to avoid out of memory problems... hopefully
------------------------------------
2.2
Added multi-language support. - thanks to elari, who wrote all the code around handling all active langs in OSC
Added category names assumed to be in default language - thanks to elari again!  who wrote all that code as well
Fixed bug where files wouldn't split because the check for EOREOR was too specific.
Added separate file for functions tep_get_uploaded_file and friends so that older snapshots will have it and work.
Finally updated the docs since they sucked
Moved product_model field to the start of each row because sometimes, if the image name was empty, the parsing would get confused
------------------------------------
2.3
Thanks to these sponsors - their financial support made this release possible!
Support for more than one output file format with variable numbers of columns
	Sponsored by Ted Joffs

Support for Separate Price per Customer mod
	Sponsored by Alan Pace

Support for Linda's Header Controller v2.0
	Sponsored by Stewart MacKenzie

Removed quotes around all the fields on export.
Added configuration variable so you can turn off the qoutes -> control codes replacement
Merged Elari's changes to not hardcode language id's
------------------------------------
2.31
Bugfix for single language non-english name/desc not being put into the output file.
The code was still checking for product_name_1 instead of product_name_$langid.
------------------------------------
2.32 - never released into the wild
Added config var $zero_qty_inactive, defaulted to true.
This will make zero qty items inactive by default.
---- STILL NEED TO DEBUG THIS! ----
------------------------------------
2.4
Support for Froogle downloads to EP.
	Sponsored by Ted Joffs
Changed comments - it's not Multiple Price per Product, it's
Separate Price per Customer.
------------------------------------
2.41beta
Fixed bugs with Froogle:
1. Category not getting built right
2. Strip HTML from name/description
3. Handle SearchEngineFriendly URL's

Adding "Delete" capability via EP. -- NOT COMPLETE
Fixed bug - the Model/Category would give SQL errors
Fixed bug - Items with no manufacturer were getting a man of '' (empty string)
Fixed bug - When trying to import, all items gave a "Deleting product" message but no db changes
	This was because I'd tried inserting the delete functionality and didn't finish it.
	Commented it out for now.
Added Date_added, fixed Date_available
Fixed active/inactive status settings
Fixed bug with misnamed item for Linda's Header Controller support
Fixed bug with SQL syntax error with new products
These following 3 fixes thanks to Yassen Yotov
	Fixed bug where the default image name vars weren't declared global in function walk()
	Added set_time_limit call, it won't cover all cases, but hopefully many. commented out to avoid
		complaints with safe mode servers
	Fixed hardcoded catalog/temp/ in output string for splitting files
------------------------------------
2.5
DJZeon found a bug where product URL was getting lost because I always deleted and inserted the product description info - fixed
Same bug also was causing times viewed to be reset to zero because I always deleted and inserted the product descriiption.
Added the multi-image lines from Debbie and Nickie - Thanks!
Changed the output file name to make more sense, now it looks like EP2003Mar20-09:45.txt
------------------------------------
2.51
No code changes, bump version because I forgot to update the docs about the high-to-low category order
------------------------------------
2.53
Bug fixes?
------------------------------------
2.60
Fix froogle categories in reverse order bug
Comment out mimage lines that were causing problems for people in 2.53
Added separator configuration variable so you can pick the separator character to use.
Made Froogle download look for an applicable specials price
Froogle downloads have "froogle" at the start of the file name
You can now specify a file in the temp directory and it will upload that instead of uploading via the browser
------------------------------------
2.61-MS2
Bug fixes thanks to frozenlightning.com
Replaced tep_array_merge with array_merge to bring up to MS2 Standards.
Modified by Deborah Carney, inspired by the Think Tank to be included in the CRE Loaded 6
New support will be found at http://phesis.co.uk in the forums, as well as at forums.oscommerce.com in the Contributions section.  This script was/is written by volunteers, please don't email or PM them, more answers are available in the forums if you search.  If you want EP to do something, someone else probably already asked....
Known issue:  html in the product description gets messed up, not sure how to fix it.
------------------------------------
2.62-MS2
Modified by Karlheinz Meier on 08.August.2003
As some people happen to have something like DIFFERENT_Prefix_TABLES in their databases,
normally there is a file called /admin/includes/database_tables.php
which defines nice varibales for them; you can for example make prefixed_databases, or live backups or so.
As some programmers did use DIRECT table names, this was changed.
And now if you use the "separte price..."-module and have an article where there is NO special price,
the import process won't die
------------------------------------

v 1.2.5.7.csv

-- fixed bug where the new added custom field section was not getting uninstalled from database when uninstallation was run.
-- added "Download Model/Price/Qty/Last Modified/Status .csv file to edit" to download as I needed date modified to change when uploading so that an addon I use auto catches which item was edited inorder to change quantity on eBay.
-- version number was 1.2.5.6 but in easypopulate admin section 1.2.5.5 was still showing.

Mod looks great and works perfectly, I would like to thank the creator and all the people that have kept it up to date.
